# Mapping the Web
## By Landen King and Owen Marcus-Lether

The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical devices that are connected to the internet, allowing them to collect and exchange info.

These devices, often embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies, can communicate with each other and be controlled remotely. IoT has applications in many areas, from smart homes to healthcare.

A common example is a smart doorbell: these devices connect to the Internet to permit people to greet others who come to their homes while they're away. 

As more devices become connected, IoT is expected to make automation, data analysis, and personalized experiences better. 

It also raises concerns about security, privacy, and data management.
